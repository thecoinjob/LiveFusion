     * Every queued target, one after another, on one loaded pipeline -- roadmap 14.
     *
     * ⚠ THIS IS A SIXTH GATED PROCESSING PATH. `docs/gate.md` enumerates them and this is
     * now on that list. Every item is checked with the SAME `ContentGate.checkVideo` a
     * single run makes, and a refused clip is marked refused while the queue CONTINUES --
     * one refusal is not a reason to abandon eleven other clips.
     *
     * The source is gated ONCE, at the top: it is the same image for every item, so
     * checking it twelve times would be twelve identical answers. It was already checked
     * when it was picked, too (setSourceFrom).
     *
     * What is hoisted out of the loop is what does not vary: the model check, init, and
     * setSource. That is the entire performance argument for one-source-many-targets -- a
     * twelve-clip batch loads ~266 MB of context binaries once rather than twelve times.
     *
     * ⚠ Trim and frame rate are NOT applied per item. A trim range means nothing across
     * clips of different lengths, so the queue takes each clip whole; the visible target
     * keeps its own trim only when it is run alone.
     *
     * ⚠ Lifetime: this runs in the Activity's scope, exactly as a single run does, so
     * leaving the app is survivable but destroying the Activity is not. The foreground
     * service that fixes that is the second half of roadmap 14 and is not written yet.
