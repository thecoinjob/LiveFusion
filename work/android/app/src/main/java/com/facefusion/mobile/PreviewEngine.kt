/**

 * The two halves have wildly different costs, and the whole design follows from that:
 *
 *  * [frameAt] is a video seek, tens of milliseconds, safe to run whenever the handle moves;
 *  * [swap] needs the pipeline loaded, and loading it reads ~266 MB of context binaries off
 *    disk. Once warm, a frame costs about what one video frame costs during a real run.
 *
 * So the pipeline is kept WARM across scrubs and invalidated only when something that feeds
 * `NativePipe.init` actually changes. The caller decides when to pay for the first warm-up.
