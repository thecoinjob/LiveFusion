/**
 * Record what the Live tab is showing — roadmap 13b.
 *
 * Frames arrive already swapped, as BGR, from the same `liveFrame` pump that draws the
 * preview: `NativePipe.liveFrame` keeps the full-resolution swapped frame natively and
 * copies it out only while a recording is running. So recording costs one buffer copy per
 * frame, not a second trip through the pipeline.
 *
 * ⚠ **ByteBuffer input, not a Surface.** The obvious design is `createInputSurface` plus
 * GL, but the frames here are bytes in memory, not textures — feeding a Surface would mean
 * uploading each frame to a texture only to have the encoder read it back. `VideoSwapper`
 * already established the ByteBuffer path for exactly this reason, and this reuses its
 * hardest-won detail: `getInputImage` rather than a packed I420 blob, because
 * `COLOR_FormatYUV420Flexible` does not imply I420 and this device's AVC encoder is
 * semi-planar. Writing I420 into it puts luma in the right place and chroma in the wrong
 * one — a greyscale picture with green and pink blobs.
 *
 * ⚠ **Timestamps come from the wall clock, never from a frame counter.** Live is variable
 * frame rate by nature: ~15 fps with a face in shot and ~29 without, and slower again on
 * the ncnn backend. A file written with evenly spaced timestamps plays back at the wrong
 * speed — faster where the phone was working hardest — and it looks like a performance
 * problem rather than the timestamp bug it is.
 *
 * Optional microphone audio starts with the video clock and is muxed after encoding.
