/**
 * The front camera, swapped, on screen. On both build lines: the gated one samples the
 * camera through [gateThreshold], which is what made shipping it possible.
 *
 * Preview ONLY: no encoder, no muxer, no audio. What it costs is therefore what the
 * pipeline costs, which is the point of having it -- 26.6 fps on a 720p file with tracking
 * is the number this has to live up to, minus capture and display.
 *
 * ## Why this is not just VideoSwapper with a camera on the front
 *
 * VideoSwapper owns a decode/encode loop and runs to completion. This is a pump: frames
 * arrive when the sensor produces them, the pipeline is slower than the sensor, and the
 * right answer to a backlog is to throw it away rather than fall further behind.
 * `STRATEGY_KEEP_ONLY_LATEST` does exactly that and also guarantees ONE frame in flight,
 * which is what lets the whole pipeline run on the analyzer thread with no lock of its own.
 *
 * ## Rotation
 *
 * The sensor hands back a landscape buffer with the face rotated 90 degrees in portrait,
 * and yoloface is not asked to find a sideways face -- `estimateFaceAngle` exists for faces
 * that are rotated in the FRAME, not for a frame that is rotated whole.
 * `setOutputImageRotationEnabled(true)` makes CameraX deliver it upright instead, which is
 * cheaper than rotating 2.7 MB per frame here and is the reason camera-core 1.3 is the
 * minimum.
 *
 * ⚠ MIRRORING IS THE DISPLAY'S JOB, NOT THIS CLASS'S. The pipeline sees the true image so
 * the detector gets a face the right way round; [ui.LiveScreen] flips only what is drawn.
 * Swapping a mirrored frame would feed a mirrored face to graphs that were never measured
 * on one.
